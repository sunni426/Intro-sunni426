### Hi, I'm Sunni!
:blush: I'm from Hsinchu, Taiwan, and I am an undergraduate senior at BU double majoring in Computer and Biomedical Engineering.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development, Operating Systems, and Deep Learning, and I am excited to find the intersections between CE and BME in the healthcare-biotech industry to deliver impact in biomedicine via software development and AI.
